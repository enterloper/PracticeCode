##What's in the box?
This directory contains solutions I've come up with in the Python language. Over time these solutions may evolve, as they do I will keep the original solutions and add the latest iteration marked by a number. Each instance of a problem will be complemented by a file containing the toy problem, a brief comment on the problem and it's origin, and the following solution. 

##Opening the box:
I've created a virtual environment for these toy problems. The thought was to have all the dependencies I will need for this repository nicely kept for later use. This is not best practice but merely a convenience to myself and anyone who'd like to peruse my Python skills.

If you'd like to use the same virtual environment I'm using, you'll need to install `virtualenv` if you don't have that already, via `pip3 install virtualenv`. 
* ####Enter the virtual environment 
    * To enter into the virtual environment on a Mac/Linux machine run `source venv/bin/activate`.
    * To enter into the virtual environment on a Windows machine run `.venv/Scripts/activate.bat`.
