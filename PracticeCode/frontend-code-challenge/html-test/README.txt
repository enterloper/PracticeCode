Note: The following exercise will provide an opportunity to demonstrate your ability to work with HTML and CSS. There will not be sufficient time to complete the task but we are looking more at the foundation of how you build out a html page. We have provided all the images you should need to create this page to reflect the design. You are free to use any tools or libraries to help with this process, if you do please provide all supporting files and not just compiled output.

* Create a html page that looks like the preview.png file.
